# Study Group

## Weekly Format

- will lag the official class by 1 week to make sure there are no issues
- each week will rotate one person being responsible for reviewing and explaining the content to the group
- each person will still be responsible for learning the concepts and tools on their own, but belief is that teaching reinforces learning 

## Final Project

- Kaggle Competition (or maybe just use data from a competition as a starting point)

    - [Classifying Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news)

- Capstone style project

    - will look at what ideas/problems are currently getting funded

- Open to ideas as we go along
