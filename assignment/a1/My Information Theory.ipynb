    "[Expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) is a weighted average.  In particular, it is the average outcome of an experiment, weighted by how often each outcome occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, imagine each time you play a game one of the following happens:\n",
    "- You win \\$20.\n",
    "- You win \\$30.\n",
    "- You lose \\$20.\n",
    "\n",

    "However, this makes an assumption that all three outcomes are equally likely.  The game gets considerably less favorable if you lose 99% of the time and only $\\frac{1}{2}$% of the time do you end up in either of the winning cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the average in this new, less favorable situation, we need to use a weighted average.  That is, we need to find the average of the values of the outcomes _weighted by the probability_ of that outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) is a measure of how much knowing one outcome tells you about another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  if I tell you it's raining, you'd probably guess it's cloudy.  But if I told you one die rolled 6, you couldn't guess what the other die rolled. Applied to language, if you mention the word \"rain\", I learn that you're more likely to also say \"wet\" or \"umbrella\" in the same context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for PMI is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PMI}(x, y) = \\log_2\\frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)\\ p(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it measures the chance two outcomes tend to co-occur (the numerator) relative to the chance they would co-occur if they were independent events (the denominator). The $\\log_2$ makes it easier to reason about very large or very small values of this ratio - and let's us give it a unit: bits. We'll explain more about this in Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Point-wise\" refers to the fact that we're picking single outcomes for \"x\" and \"y\" (i.e. x = \"raining\", y = \"cloudy\").  Without the point-wise (i.e. just [\"mutual information\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information)) refers to the average (expected value) point-wise mutual information between all possible assignments to x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions 1(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the value of PMI when x and y are independent events?  When is PMI higher?  Lower?\n",
    "2. If $P(\\text{rainy}, \\text{cloudy})= 0.1$, $P(\\text{rainy}) = 0.2$ and $P(\\text{cloudy}) = 0.8$, what is $\\text{PMI}(\\text{rainy}, \\text{cloudy})$?\n",
    "3. Imagine $x$ is some word in a sentence, and $y$ is the next word in the sentence.  Imagine $P(\\text{washington})=0.01$, $P(\\text{post}) = 0.01$, and $P(\\text{washington}, \\text{post}) = 0.002$.  What is $\\text{PMI}(\\text{washington}, \\text{post})$?
